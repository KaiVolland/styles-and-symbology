# Gridded Coverage Extensdion

This directory will contain conceptual and logical models
extending the SymCore conceptual and logical models
to define styling and symbology for gridded coverages.
It will extend both how expressions correspond to the data
(e.g., identifiers referencing measured or observed properties)
and symbolizer properties allowing to define rendering styles
for that data (e.g., assigning derived field expressions to
color channels, colormaps, hill shading).
