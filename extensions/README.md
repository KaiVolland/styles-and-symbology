# Extensions

This directory will contain conceptual and logical models
extending the SymCore conceptual and logical models
to define styling and symbology for specific types of data, such as
vector features and gridded coverages.
It will extend both how expressions correspond to the data
(e.g., identifiers referencing measured or observed properties)
and symbolizer properties allowing to define rendering styles
for that data (e.g., fills and strokes).
