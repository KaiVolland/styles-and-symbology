# This directory contains a draft of the conceptual and logical models
# extending the SymCore conceptual and logical models
# to define styling and symbology for vector features.
# It will extend both how expressions correspond to the data
# (e.g., identifiers referencing measured or observed properties)
# and symbolizer properties allowing to define rendering styles
# for that data (e.g., fills and strokes).
