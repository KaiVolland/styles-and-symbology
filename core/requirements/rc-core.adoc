[requirement]

identifier:: /req/core/styling-rules
part:: An Encoding SHALL support individually storing and preserving the order of each StylingRule constituting a Style.
part:: A Renderer SHALL support considering in order each individual StylingRule constituting a style.
part:: The Symbolizer properties specified in a StylingRule appearing later in a Style's list of rules and whose Selector
evaluates to true SHALL be interpreted as overriding all Symbolizer properties set by earlier rules.

Below are the old requirements from SymCore 1.0 for the Core conformance class.
They will be likely replaced by being more specific and less generic, and not necessarily map one-to-one to the UML classes,
and discuss both Encoding as well as Renderer target implementations.

| Req 1	| http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology-1/2.0/req/core/StyleClass Implementations shall support the encoding of all properties of the StyleClass and meet all of the tabulated constraints and notes.
| Req 2	| http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology-1/2.0/req/core/RuleClass Implementations shall support the encoding of all RuleClass properties and meet all of the tabulated constraints and notes.

| Req 5	| http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology-1/2.0/req/core/LiteralClass Implementations shall support the encoding of all parameters of the LiteralClass and meet all of the tabulated constraints and notes.
| Req 6	| http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology-1/2.0/req/core/UOMClass Implementations shall support the encoding of all properties of the UOMClass and meet all of the tabulated constraints and notes.

| Req 8	| http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology-1/2.0/req/core/FillClass Implementations shall support the encoding of all properties of the FillClass and meet all of the tabulated constraints and notes.
| Req 9	| http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology-1/2.0/req/core/StrokeClass Implementations shall support the encoding of all properties of the StrokeClass and meet all of the tabulated constraints and notes.
| Req 10	| http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology-1/2.0/req/core/GraphicClass Implementations shall support the encoding of all properties of the GraphicClass and meet all of the tabulated constraints and note.
| Req 11 | http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology-1/2.0/req/core/GraphicSizeClass Implementations shall support the encoding of all properties of the GraphicSizeClass and meet all of the tabulated constraints and notes.
| Req 12	| http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology-1/2.0/req/core/LabelClass Implementations shall support the encoding of all properties of the LabelClass and meet all of the tabulated constraints and notes.
