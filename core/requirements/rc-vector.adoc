[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/vector/fill
part:: An Encoding SHALL support defining a `fill` Symbolizer property as an object including a `color` and an `opacity`.
part:: A Renderer SHALL support filling vector geometry based on a `fill` property specifying a `color` and an `opacity`.
====

////
Below are the old requirements from SymCore 1.0 for the Core conformance class.
They will be likely replaced by being more specific and less generic, and not necessarily map one-to-one to the UML classes,
and discuss both Encoding as well as Renderer target implementations.
