== Requirements Class "3D Models and Transforms"
=== Overview

This requirements class adds support for defining how to use and transform 3D models. This includes the ability to define the position, orientation, and scaling of a model. This class also includes the ability to define the position, orientation, and scaling of a model's individual parts.

// Do we need to define a new uml diagram for this ?
