== Mapping of SLD/SE and notable vendor extensions to the Conceptual Model

This annex maps constructs of the OGC Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) and Symbology Encoding (SE) 1.1
to the conceptual model and requirements classes defined in this Standard, with the goal of facilitating
conformance to this Standard for Rendering engines based on SLD/SE and writing conversion tools
that can convert in either or both direction between SLD/SE and the two encodings defined in this
Standard.
