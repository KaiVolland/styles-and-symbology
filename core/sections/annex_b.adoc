== EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTATION

The Symbology Conceptual Core Model standard implies that a concrete style extension is implemented to control how the features of a certain data model are rendered. The following example is given for information only. It must be read and understood as a fictitious implementation of an extension.

Let us introduce the AreaFeatureTypeStyle extension which holds a simple and classical symbolizer, call it the AreaSymbolizer extension which describes the graphical parameters for drawing polygonal features with outlined and filled surface areas.

Figure B.1 shows the fundamental concepts of the Symbology Conceptual Core Model that must be implemented to create the AreaFeatureTypeStyle extension.

Note that this extension doesn’t contain any rule mechanisms such as MinScaleDenominator and MaxScaleDenominator or/and filter operators.

=== AreaFeatureTypeStyle extension

The AreaFeatureTypeStyle extension defines the styling that is to be applied to a single feature type.

This class extends the abstract Style class described in the core. It defines the ability to portray of a Layer built of N instances of GML AbstractFeatureType3 with the ability to access features according to Simple Feature SF-24.

The rendering engine is driven according to the following execution: all features are applied to each symbolizer in sequence as they appear nested in rule and following the “painter’s model” with the first item in a list being the first item plotted and hence being on the “bottom”.

|===
| Name	| Definition	| Data type and value	| Multiplicity
| featureTypeName	| Identifies the specific feature type that the feature-type style is for	| Literal data type	| zero or one
|===

To define the access to the exact feature type geometry to style, the extension adds a geometry property to the AreaSymbolizer with the related behaviours (described below for each requirement).

=== AreaSymbolizer extension

An AreaSymbolizer is used to symbolize a geometry into an area including filling its interior and stroking its outline. It is typically used for a 2-dimensional geometry (e.g., Polygon).

.AreaSymbolizer extension
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name	| Definition	| Data type and value	| Multiplicity
| fill	| Filling style to draw the interior area	| Fill data type	| Zero or one
| stroke	| Stroke style to draw the outline	| Stroke data type	| Zero or one
|===

(a) If a geometry has “holes,” then they are not filled, but the borders around the holes are stroked in the usual way if a Stroke parameter is mentioned. “Islands” within holes are filled and stroked, and so on. If a point is used, then a small, square, orthogonal-normal area should be constructed for rendering. If a line is used, then the line (string) is closed for filling (only) by connecting its end point to its start point, any line crossings are corrected in some way, and only the original line is stroked. (b) A missing Fill property means that the geometry will not be filled. A missing Stroke property means that the geometry will not be stroked. When both are used, the filling is rendered first and then the stroking rendered on top of the filling.

=== SolidFill extension

The SolidFill class is a concrete implementation of the Fill class and allows to formulate a filling of an area (e.g., a polygon geometry or any kind of symbol).

.SolidFill extension
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name	| Definition	| Data type and value	| Multiplicity
| color	| The color to fill the area	| Color data type	| zero or one
| opacity	| Opacity of the Color	| ParameterValue type (Float) Value: [0;1] (1 means 100% opaque) Default value: 0	| zero or one
|===

Note: Any fill implementation can be imagined as for example a TextureFill extension to add a level of artistic control and realism to a surface. For complex Texture properties, a specific Symbolizer could be proposed.

=== PenStroke extension

The PenStroke extension is a concrete implementation of the Stroke class. It allows to draw a line (e.g., a 1-dimensional geometry, the outline of a marker, etc.) analogously to how a pen is used with ink, that is to say by filling the area formed by the thickness of the line.

.PenStroke extension
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name	| Definition	| Data type and value	| Multiplicity
| width	| Thickness of the line which gives form to an area to fill (a)	| ParameterValue data type (Float) Value: [0;+∞) | Default value: 1px	| zero or one
| fill	| The filling style to draw the linear area	| Fill data type	| zero or one
|===

(a) The Width parameter is in the context of a UnitOfMeasure code (that may be inherited from a parent element).

=== RGBColor extension

The RGBColor extension is a concrete implementation of the Color class where the color is expressed as three integer properties in conformance with the sRGB standardized color space.

.RGBColor extension
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name	| Definition	| Data type and value	| Multiplicity
| red	| The red value of the color	| ParameterValue data type (Integer) Value: (0;255) Default value: 0	| one
| green	| The green value of the color	| ParameterValue data type (Integer) Value: (0;255) Default value: 0	| one
| blue	| The blue value of the color	| ParameterValue data type (Integer) Value: (0;255) Default value: 0	| one
