== Scope

This Standard presents the requirements that define version 2.0 of the _Styles and Symbology Model and Encodings - Part 1: Core_ (_"SymCore 2.0"_).
A Model for the portrayal of geographic data is defined at both the conceptual and logical levels, in a modular manner through the use of separate requirements classes and specific extension points.
The requirements classes defined by this first part cover the most common use cases for portraying geospatial vector features and coverages.
Several scenarios of varying complexity and the associated requirements classes enabling them are illustrated in an annex.
Two encodings are defined by this Standard: one based on JSON which can be readily parsed with JSON parser, and another more expressive encoding inspired from Web Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
better suited for hand-editing style sheets. Future parts to this Standard may further extend the portrayal capabilities by defining additional requirements classes.

The _Styles and Symbology Model_ is a new approach (Bocher E., Ertz O., 2018, see Annex B):

- to provide the flexibility required to achieve adequate cartographic styling and fill the needs of a variety of information communities; e.g., aviation symbols, weather symbols, thematic maps, etc.; and
- to achieve high level styling interoperability without encoding dependencies.

We need to diagrams to illustrate the conformance classes and encoding and the fact that this is all included in this standard.

Figure 2 explains the relation between the core, the potential extensions, and their encodings. A community style extension must be based on a core element and will be encoding-independent. An extension should have a concrete encoding. As the figure shows encoding could be implemented in various formats.
