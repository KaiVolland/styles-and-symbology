== Requirements Classes for Coverage styling

=== Requirements Class "Basic Coverage Styling"
==== Overview

This requirements class adds support for defining how to portray coverage data by mapping
values from the range (e.g., individual imagery bands) to color channels or to a single channel, as well
as providing an option to apply a color and/or opacity map based on the values.

===== Extended Identifiers

This requirements class defines as valid identifiers all of the accessible properties (the values of its range, as defined by the range type)
for a coverage being portrayed with the name of those properties being the text of the identifier.
Those identifiers are to be resolved with the value of that property.
An encoding must support an escaping mechanism in cases where the name of a feature property might clash with a syntactic element.

| colorChannels     | Value of the Red, Green and Blue color channels | Color                 | 0..1
| alphaChannel      | Value of the alpha (opacity) channel            | float                 | 0..1

| opacityMap        | Opacity map to be applied based on singleCannel | ValueOpacity          | 0..*
|===

This requirements class requires support for identifier parameter value expression for the red (`r`), green (`g`) and blue (`b`) components of
the `colorChannels`, `alphaChannel` and `singleChannel` properties without any additional requirements class.

This allows to map the range values of a coverage to the output color channels.

The color map is defined with a Value/Color pair object:

.ValueColor properties

|===
| Name                | Definition	                                         | Data type and value | Multiplicity
| value               | Key value for selecting this color                   | float               | 1
| color               | Color associated with this value                     | Color               | 1
| name                | Label to use for this value when generating a legend | string              | 0..1
|===

Similarly, the opacity map is defined with a Value/Opacity pair object:

.ValueOpacity properties
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name                | Definition	                                         | Data type and value | Multiplicity
| value               | Key value for selecting this color                   | float               | 1
| color               | Color associated with this value                     | Color               | 1
| name                | Label to use for this value when generating a legend | string              | 0..1
|===

===== Colors

Both the `colorChannels` and the `colorMap` properties use a Color class, specified using red, green and blue components.
The ability to define Colors in other spaces (e.g., Lab, CMYK) is defined in separate requirements classes
and applies wherever this basic RGB Color class is used.

| r	   | Red          | float                 | 1
| g	   | Green        | float                 | 1
| b	   | Blue         | float                 | 1
