== Requirements Class "Cascading Cartographic Symbology Style Sheets"

=== Overview

This requirements class defines an encoding for the Styles and Symbology Logical Model inspired from Web Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and other CSS-like cartographic symbology encodings.
The primary objective of this encoding is to be easy to be expressive and facilitate hand-edition by cartographers.
Parsing this encoding requires a custom parser.
