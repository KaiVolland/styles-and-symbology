== Conformance Classes

Initial take at organizing new Styling UML Model as conformance classes

=== Conformance Classes for basic rendering

==== Core

* Style / StylingRule
* Symbolizer (opacity, visibility, zOrder)
* System Identifiers
  ** Layer ID
  ** Scale denominator (explain relationship to zoom levels)
   *** Transitions between scales/zoom levels (preference if supported?)
* (Limited) Expressions as selectors (e.g., Basic CQL2)
 ** Identifiers (on one side of relation)
 ** Literals
 ** Relations
 ** Logic
 ** Sub-expressions (parentheses for operation priority)

==== Basic Vector Features Styling

* Solid fills
* Solid stroke
* Markers (only translation transform)
* Dot, Image & Text Graphic (only usable in Markers, only translation)
* Fonts, Alignment, Colors
* Identifier (Property) expressions as ParameterValue for Text graphics 'text' property

==== Basic Coverage Styling

* colorChannel, singleChannel, alphaChannels (with identifier value ParameterValue for those properties) -- see coverageSymbolizer
* colorMap, opacityMap

==== Hill Shading

* Consider polygon vector + light direction hillshading

=== Conformance classes for additional Labeling Capabilities

==== Font Outlines

==== Basic Labeling

* Label placement algorithm
* Label rendering past last
* min / max spacing
* priority
* Label as MultiGraphic

=== Conformance classes for additional Vector Graphics Capabilities

==== Dashes, Stipples, Hatches and Gradients

* Dash pattern Strokes
* Hatch fills
* Stipple fills
* Gradient fills

==== Joins and Caps

* Custom Joins and Caps on Strokes

==== Casing and Centerline

* Casing and center line on Strokes

==== Shape Graphics

* Paths (Polylines / Polygons), Rectangles & Rounded Rectangles, Arcs (Open/Chord/Sector), Circles, Ellipses
* Fills and Strokes on those graphics
* Use of these graphics as Markers (Labels if supported)
* Only translation transforms

==== Shapes Outlines

==== Multi Graphics and Transforms

* MultiGraphic (Graphics hierarchies)
* Full transforms
* GraphicInstance

==== Pattern Strokes and Fills

* Graphic patterns for Strokes & Fills

=== Conformance classes for additional Expressions Capabilities

==== Full ParameterValues Support

* Parameter Values for any Symbolizer properties

==== Function Expressions

==== Arithmetic Operations

==== Bitwise Operators

==== Text Relation Operators (e.g., CQL2 'Like')

==== Spatial Relation Functions

==== Temporal Relation Functions

==== Array Relation Functions

==== Text Manipulation Functions

==== Geometry Manipulation Functions

==== Variables (e.g., map to an app slider)

==== Right-hand identifiers (e.g., CQL2 Property-Property comparison)
