== Overview

This Standard defines conformance classes for:

* additional conformance classes extending the core Cartographic Symbology model with:
   ** the ability to represent coverages as points or contour lines, enhance contrast or adjust hue, saturation and/or value (<<rc-coverage-as-contours,Section 7>>),
   ** the definition of an aggregation function (<<rc-aggregation,Section 8>>), and
   ** operators for performing operation on individual bits (<<rc-bitwise,Section 9>>).

////
In addition, the following annexes are included:

* a normative Abstract Test Suite for the conformance classes (<<annex-ats,Annex A>>),
* an informative mapping of SLD/SE and notable vendor extensions to the conceptual model and requirements classes (<<annex-sldse,Annex B>>),
* an informative map gallery of practical use cases alongside the styles used to generate the maps encoded in the _Cascading Cartographic and Symbology Style Sheets_ encoding (<<annex-mapgallery,Annex C>>), and
* an informative revision history (<<annex-revisions,Annex D>>).

We need new diagrams to illustrate the conformance classes and encoding and the fact that this is all included in this standard.

Figure 2 explains the relation between the core, the potential extensions, and their encodings. A community style extension must be based on a core element and will be encoding-independent. An extension should have a concrete encoding. As the figure shows encoding could be implemented in various formats.
