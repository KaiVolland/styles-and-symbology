== Scope

This document presents the requirements that define the Symbology Conceptual Core Model (SymCore). The SymCore is a conceptual, modular, neutral model for the portrayal of geographical data. The model contains a minimal set of abstract classes representing explicit extension points of the model. Note: this document does not define any extensions.

Even though the SymCore could be extended in many places (such as Color or ParameterValue), the abstract Style class must be considered as the root element for portraying a geographic data model and for defining a concrete style model, e.g., specific style dedicated to render 2D vector data or a style for 3D, Virtual Reality, or Augmented Reality topics (Figure 1).

The SymCore is a new approach (Bocher E., Ertz O., 2018, see Annex B):

- to provide the flexibility required to achieve adequate cartographic styling and fill the needs of a variety of information communities; e.g., aviation symbols, weather symbols, thematic maps, etc.; and
- to achieve high level styling interoperability without encoding dependencies.

Figure 2 explains the relation between the core, the potential extensions, and their encodings. A community style extension must be based on a core element and will be encoding-independent. An extension should have a concrete encoding. As the figure shows encoding could be implemented in various formats.
